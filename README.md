# OPENAI - GO API

This is a simple **unofficial** Go app that requests OpenAI's platform models such as GPT or DALL-E, to provide Chat Completions for instance.

## Getting Started:

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites:

Before you can use this application, you need to have the following:

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Docker 23.0 or higher
- An OpenAI account with an active payment method
    - An active [(OpenAI API Key)](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è** Note that the OpenAI API Key is **NOT** optional, you will need to create one and add it in the `.env` file.

### Setup:

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/charafzellou/openai-golang-api
```

Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd openai-golang-api
```

Create an environment file `.env` with your personal access token:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_personal_access_token
```

### Usage as a binary:

To use the Go binary directly, run the following command:

```bash
make build
make exec
```

If you wanna run the Go source code directly without building, run the following command:

```bash
make run
```

### Usage as a Docker container:

Build the Docker image with the following command:

```bash
make docker-build
```

Run the Docker container from the image we created:

```bash
make docker-run
```

This will start the application and return your request's result.
